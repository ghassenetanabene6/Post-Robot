# Post-Robot

This project is part of a collaboration between the **ENSI Robotics Association** and the **Tunisian Post**.

**Post Robot:** is an autonomous robot delivering parcels by reading the QR-code. This robot, playing the role of a post agent, recognizes its way with the help of two cameras and distributes the packages to the appropriate stations.

This robot model can also be used indoors in industrial companies and service areas.

The presentation of this project was made during **World Post Day on October 9, 2019** and in the presence of the **Minister of Technology Mr. Anouar Maârouf**.
